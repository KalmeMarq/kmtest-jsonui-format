# KM Json UI Format (Testing)

I plan to make a JsonUI mod for Minecraft Java and this repo is for me to put files with the format that I'm currently testing.

The format that Bugrock uses it's complicated to parse without getting into a big mess so I want to make my own and add more unique features too.
